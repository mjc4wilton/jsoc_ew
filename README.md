## Contribution

Please PLEASE do NOT contribute at this time. This mod is nowhere near feature or core framework complete and you will be most likely wasting your time. If you wish to contribute, please contact mjc4wilton directly prior to attempting anything.

## WIP Disclaimer

This mod is heavily a work in progress. The "Pre-Releases" are built by me seemingly arbitrarily and utilizing a seemingly arbitrary versioning scheme to keep it consistant to the 77th JSOC's modpack updates while it is being actively developed and playtested. If you use this mod and something is broken, there's a good chance there is a reason it's broken and I already know about it.
